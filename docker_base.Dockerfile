# Stages:
#   root       : Common image, both for the builder and for the final image.
#                This contains only minimal dependencies required in both cases
#                for miniconda and the Makefile.
#   env_builder: stage in which the conda envrionment is created
#                and dependencies are installed
#   base       : the final image containing only the required environment files,
#                and none of the infrastructure required to generate them.
